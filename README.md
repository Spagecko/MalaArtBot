# MalaArtBot
This is a personal project wilt collaboration with a buddy to create a database of art using firebase from discord a server, and creating a bot that would print out the images randomly when called upon
This project is hosted on Glitch.io. The bot waits for a keyword to run the script.  When called upon the Bot calls upon the database which is hosted on Google firebase then picks an image randomly to replies with. However since it's also a printer it has a chance to fail.If that happens the Bot will reply with a fail message which is also stored on the database. Bot will continue to wait till the next command is heard.
